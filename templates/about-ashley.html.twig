                        My first experience with breath work was on a wellness retreat - I had been dealing with chronic pain for almost two years and decided to try something new.  At the end of my first pranayama class, I noticed that the pain had subsided. I initially thought was a coincidence, but over the course of the next few days and the next few classes, the pain just kept subsiding.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-8 pl-12">
                        After returning home, I read everything I could about breath work and discovered Pranayama. I quickly became a daily student and was transformed by the practice. I loved how healing and accessible the breathing was, and the relief it brought me.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-8">
                        Initially, I wanted to get certified so that I could elevate my own practice, but my teacher was so inspiring that it quickly grew into something bigger. As I offered practice sessions to friends and family, I felt so much gratitude from them and their experience, that I decided to dedicate more of my time to teaching and introducing others to Pranayama.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The classes I offer are meant to provide people a safe space to experience healing, reconnect, feel grounded and find a release. The brightest light is within; my goal is to help you find it.
